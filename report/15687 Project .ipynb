    "# How can Taxis enhance the Singapore's Public Transport System.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Bus and rail system have fixed routes and schedules. Therefor they have deterministic coverage patterns which meet the general transportation demand. Taxicabs and ride sharing services do not have fixed routes or schedules thus in some sense, they meet the \"ad hoc\" demands. The goal of the project is to see if the supply pattern of taxicabs fill the gaps in the public transport network thereby enhancing it. \n",
    "The study would be done for Singapore, a city state which provides plentiful data for the public transport network. While public transport modelling has been done before, to the best of our knowledge, there have not been an analysis of taxis and public transport together.\n",
