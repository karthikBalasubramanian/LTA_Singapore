# How are Taxis enhancing the Singapore's Public Transport System?
Singapore is a city nation in the South East Asia. It has an extensive public transport network that comprises of a rail network and bus network. In addition, there are street hail taxis and ride sharing services such as Grab and Uber operating the public/private space. Singapore transport system is technology advanced and data driven. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore is the regulatory authority for transportation. The LTA publishes a wide variety of transport-related datasets (static and dynamic / realtime) on DataMall for enterprises, third-party developers, and other members of the public to promote citizen co-creation of innovative and inclusive transport solutions. This is rich data source which makes Singapore suitable for a data science study.
Bus and rail system have fixed routes and schedules thus they have deterministic coverage patterns which meet a fix transportation demand. On the other hand, taxicabs and ride sharing services do not have fixed routes or schedules thus in some sense, they meet the "ad hoc" demands.
We are interested to find out if the supply pattern of taxicabs fill the gaps in the public transport network.
