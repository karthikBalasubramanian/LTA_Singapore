    "Bus and rail system have fixed routes and schedules. Therefore they have deterministic coverage patterns which meet the general transportation demand. Taxicabs and ride sharing services do not have fixed routes or schedules thus in some sense, they meet the \"ad hoc\" demands. The goal of the project is to see if the supply pattern of taxicabs fill the gaps in the public transport network thereby enhancing it. \n",
    "The study would be done for Singapore, a city state which provides plentiful data for the public transport network. While public transport modelling has been done before, to the best of our knowledge, there have not been an analysis of taxis and public transport together.\n",

Also, Knowledge of the Distribution would help us to predict the taxis in the future based on the historic allocation of taxis and buses.

Hence we decided to remove Taxis from the Airport area location. When we remove the Airports area from equation, we see many hotspot locations in the sampled dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Here is a primer to [Kernel Density Esitmation](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/kernel-density-estimation/). We chose KDE because:\n",
    "Its non-parametric, which means that it attempt to estimate the density directly from the data without assuming a particular form for the underlying distribution. We cannot assume real-life events to happend based on certain distribution. We do have problems with Kernel Density Estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What Bandwidth or window to use?\n",
    "   2. What Kernel function to use to count the number of Spatial points that fall in the vicinity of the proposed bandwidth.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The below infographic will help to understand the Factors to consider while designing KDE\n",
    "   \n",
    "  <a href=\"http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/pr/pr_l7.pdf\"> <img src=\"images/KernelDensityInfographic.png\"  width=\"700px\"></a>\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The Infographic shows the most simplest of all the kernel functions which is there. But Parzen Kernals weight every point from the center in the same way. It yields Density Estimates that have discontinuities. So we had to choose a Kernel which smoothen the effects of the above drawbacks. Though there are many [Kernels](https://goo.gl/fCN79N), We decided to go with the Epanechnikov kernel which provides the most unbiased estimation of KDE.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  Now we have decided on a Kernel, We have to decide on a free parameter, the Bandwidth. The problems with deciding on Bandwidth are that, if we increase the bandwidth (a radius for spatial area) We might oversmooth the Kernel density that we are trying to estimate (even an Epanechnikov kernel with a wrong bandwidth would become an unbiased estimator). If we use a small bandwidth, we might undersmooth, i.e, we might get muliple distribution peaks in the spatial graph. We will have to find a h that will reduce the error between estimated density and the true density. But we don't know the true density of the spatial data that we have and its altogether a different problem to solve. So we decided to go with a kernel bandwidth of 500 meters radius and 1 KM radius. We will provide both the analysis below.\n",

    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " We have 3 steps here. \n",
    " \n",
    " 1. For a stream of datapoints with timestamp and UTM coordinates (In both the cases of bus and taxi), group them into a timeframe of 15 minutes.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. For each data point in the grouped time window, Fit the surrounding points that fall within the given bandwidth (500 meters/1000 meters), Score these points which are within the bandwidth based on the Kernel function (Epanechnikov Kernel Function). Distance between two points is calculated by [Minkowski Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance) which in two dimension is nothing but Euclidean Distance.We used [KDTree Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) to make the distance computation faster. Here is an intutive video explanation of [how KDTree works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4dNLvno-EY).\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. After deriving the kernel density model for a given datapoint with a bandwidth and kernel funcion, we sample the datapoints within the data model and calculate the total log probability under the model.\n",

Sometimes, users cannot avail taxis as well during the nightly hours as the drivers will be on a [shift-change](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4kga3c/beating_change_shift_taxis_drivers_at_game/#bottom-comments).
